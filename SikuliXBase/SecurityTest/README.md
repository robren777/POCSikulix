### Basic info
Test examples made with OWASP ZAP and C# as a Unit Test Project

### Getting started
After instaling OWASP ZAP you need the API key, ZAP url and ZAP port. The port will probably be 8080.

* Example of the settings:
    * _zapApiKey = "mvh6ikkv28rptc7qm5fn0vpdhh"
    * _zapApiKey = "mvh6ikkv28rptc7qm5fn0vpdhh"
    * _zapPort = 8080;
